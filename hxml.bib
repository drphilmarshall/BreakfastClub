         note = "{Discussed 2020-01-28. This paper suggests getting around the need for an explicit pdf in variational inference by using ratio estimation. The ratio estimation is deterministic, and the posterior samples are a deterministic process with noisy inputs. This work is explicit about the global variables being used (akin to the global cosmological parameters in our case).}"
